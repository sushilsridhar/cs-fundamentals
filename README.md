# How computer starts  
power on   
-> CPU on (POST - power on self test begin, basic diagnostic check) after diagnostic complete, sends signal to ROM    
-> BIOS (stored on ROM) initializes hardware before loading operating system, reads the hard drive, encounters the first piece of operating system, bootstrap loader     
-> bootstrap loader, loads the operating system and hand over the control to it    
-> operating system, it is loaded from hard drive to RAM (which is memory accessed by CPU) by bootstrap loader, OS's important functions are 1.Processor management 2.Memory management 3.Device management 4.Storage management 5.Application interface 6.User interface  
-> Every other programs started, are loaded into RAM for processing.
