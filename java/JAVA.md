# Java


# Immutability 

This concept applies only to Java Objects, when you change primitive types, say a int value from 1 to 2, you change the whole value itself, that is not immutability or mutability,  

<ins>String class</ins>   
String are immutable, so that they can be shared across mutliple threads  
[Strings in heap shared between multiple threads](https://github.com/sushilsridhar/cs-fundamentals/blob/main/ds/STRING.md#when-to-think-of-strings)

<ins>Wrapper class</ins> - check for real reason    
Generics does not support primitive types, so wrapper classes around the primitive types was created,
