# GCD

Greatest common divisor, Highest common factor (hcf) -> both are same  

gcd(a,b) -> greatest factor which divides both a and b    

5 is the gcd   
15 -> 1 3  5 15   
25 -> 1 5 25  

6/2 = 3, 2 * 3 are the factors, so the word divisor and factors are same  

gcd(10, -25) is 5, -25 will have both positive and negative factors, -5 and 5, greatest is positive factor  

# Properties of GCD

- gcd(a,b) = gcd(|a|,|b|)
- gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,a) -> commutative 
- gcd(0,x) is |x|,  
  if x = 0, then gcd(0,0) is undefined
- gcd(a,b,c) = gcd(gcd(a,b), c) = gcd(gcd(a,c), b) = gcd(gcd(b,c), a)
