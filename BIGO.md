# Asymptotic analysis  
Definition - Observing performance for larger inputs.   
BigO Defintion - Given a function f(N), if there atleast exists 2 constants, c & N0 such that, c * g(N) >= f(N), where N >= N0 (N0 - spelled as N not)  
Execution time factors - programming language, OS, so time complexity should be always calculated on number of iterations.  
BigO - keeps a upper bound, in general while calculating the complexity we keep the value which is upper bound (highest).
