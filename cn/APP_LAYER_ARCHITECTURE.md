# Application layer architecture

<ins>Client-Server</ins>    

Data is owned by server, client doesn't own any data    
Client consumes data   

Centralized Server, serves data

<ins>Peer-Peer</ins>        

no centralized server, every one is client as well as server

eg: Torrent, each machine is uploader and downloader        
blockchain, old skype
