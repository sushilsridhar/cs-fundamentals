# Computer Networks

<ins>Protocol</ins> is a set of rules that governs the transmission between two computers    

# OSI model
Open Systems Interconnection
> OSI model is a reference model/tool to actually model or trace the actual flow of how data transfers in networks 

> It is a logical representation of how the network systems are supposed to send data (or, communicate) to each other

# Internet Protocol Suite - TCP/IP 
> OSI model is a reference model while TCP/IP is an implementation of OSI model

TCP/IP Model helps you to determine how a specific computer should be connected to the internet and how data should be transmitted between them 

OSI model gives guidelines on how communication needs to be done, while TCP/IP protocols layout standards on which the Internet was developed

Application layer, Presentation layer and Session layer are managed as part of application code,   
Transport layer is managed by OS, 

<ins>Application Layer</ins>    
create data that has to be transferred over network  
``` 
Protocols: 
```


<ins>Physical Layer</ins>     
The physical layer receives the frames from the Data Link Layer and generates information on bits of electrical impulses or light depending on the medium being optical or electrical and transmits them physically bit by bit

Protocols: 

```
Presentation - encrypt/decrypt data, format data   
Session      - create sessions    

Transport    - TCP, UDP (transport Protocol are used)  
Network      - IP layer (Internet Protocol layer), 
```
