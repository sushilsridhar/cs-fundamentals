# Computer Networks

<ins>Protocol</ins> set of rules that governs the transmission between two computers    

<ins>OSI Layers</ins> 
> OSI model is a tool to actually model or trace the actual flow of how data transfers in networks 

> It is a logical representation of how the network systems are supposed to send data (or, communicate) to each other  


Application layer, Presentation layer and Session layer are managed as part of application code,   
Transport layer is managed by OS, 

<ins>Application Layer</ins>    
create data that has to be transferred over network  
``` 
Protocols: 
```


<ins>Physical Layer</ins>     
The physical layer receives the frames from the Data Link Layer and 
generates information on bits of electrical impulses or light depending on the medium being optical or electrical, 
and transmits them physically 

Protocols: 

```
Presentation - encrypt/decrypt data, format data   
Session      - create sessions    

Transport    - TCP, UDP (transport Protocol are used)  
Network      - IP layer (Internet Protocol layer), 
```
