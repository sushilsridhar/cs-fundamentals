# Object Oriented Programming

> The fundamental principle of OOP is Abstraction   

<ins>Abstraction</ins> - making something as abstract, representing something as idea     
representation of a complex system in terms of idea (data & behaviour)   

<ins>3 pillars of OOP</ins>   
1. Encapsulation    
2. Inheritance      
3. Polymorphism   


<ins>Encapsulation</ins>  
1. stores data and behaviour of an idea together
2. hides unneccessary details to the outside world
3. only expose what we want to clients using access modifiers


<ins>Class</ins>: Blueprint    
<ins>Object</ins>: Real world entity        
<ins>Constructor</ins>: default, custom, copy constructor
