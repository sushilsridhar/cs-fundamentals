# Object Oriented Programming

> The fundamental principle of OOP is Abstraction   

<ins>Abstraction</ins> - making something as abstract, representing something as idea     
representation of a complex system in terms of idea (data & behaviour)   

<ins>3 pillars of OOP</ins>   
1. Encapsulation    
2. Inheritance      
3. Polymorphism   


<ins>Encapsulation</ins>  
1. stores data and behaviour of an idea together
2. hides unneccessary details to the outside world
3. only expose what we want to clients using access modifiers


<ins>Class</ins>: Blueprint    
<ins>Object</ins>: Real world entity        
<ins>Constructor</ins>: default, custom, copy constructor   

<ins>shallow copy</ins>:  point to same address   
<ins>Deep copy</ins>: creates new object (no sharing of object)   

<ins>Inheritance</ins>    
1. OOP allows us to design hierarchial systems with categorisation         
2. reduces duplicate code        

<ins>Access modifiers</ins>: public, default, private, protected, classes can have only public or default modifier    
<ins>Super keyword</ins>: allows access to parent class members from child class ( attributes, methods and constructors)        

<ins>Polymorphism</ins>   
1. ability of somethings to have multiple forms   
2. compile time polymorphism - method overloading - (compiler knows which methods to call at compile time itself)   
3. run time polymorphism - can be achieved using method overiding   


<ins>Method overloading</ins>: multiple methods inside the same class, having the same name but different arguments or same arguments in different order      

<ins>Method overiding</ins>: overide the method with same signature with different implementation in child class, the access modifier of overiding method should be same or more freedom than parent method
