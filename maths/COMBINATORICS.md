# Combinatorics

Deals with the selection of objects according to some pattern and number of ways in which it can be done.  
- Permutation  
- Combination  

# Product rule - AND

If two events a1 and a2 can occur in m and n ways, then the number of ways of performing both (a1 AND a2) together is   
- m * n  

delhi  
| | |   
jaipur  
 |  |   
jaisalmer    

f1,f2,f3 - flights    
t1, t2 - trains  

3 - flights, 2 - trains ways, total - 6 ways to reach jaisalmer 


# Addition rule - OR

If two events a1 and a2 can occur in m and n ways, then the number of ways of performing either (a1 OR a2) is  
- m + n   

delhi  
f1 f2 f3 t1 t2  - there are 3 flights and 2 trains to reach jaipur  
jaipur  

total number of ways to reach jaipur is 3 + 2 = 5  

# Permutation

- Arrangement  

s1 s2 s3 -> arrange 3 people in the seats  

s1 - 3 possible people  
s2 - 2 possible people  
s1 - 1 possible people  


- n * n-1 * n-2 * .. n  
- formula -> n!  

N distinct objects can be arranged on N distinct places in N! ways
