# Prime numbers

> A number divisible only by 1 and itself  
> number of factors is 2

find total number of factors of a number -> tc: O(sqrt(n))  

if n%i == 0, 
> n is a factor,  
> then n/i is also a factor

Divisors - The divisor is any number that divides another number  
factors - A factor, however, is a divisor that divides the number entirely and leaves no remainder

So, all factors of a number are its divisors
