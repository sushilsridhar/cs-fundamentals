# Two Pointers

> If array is sorted, think of two pointers  

generally denotes indexes in a array  

<ins>where to place pointers</ins>  

> the pointers should be placed such that, it provides a deterministic way of discarding elements,    

1. both pointers at the start   
2. both pointers at the end   
3. one at the start and another at the end  

<ins>both pointers at the start</ins>  
increasing j, increases result  
increasing i, decreases result
