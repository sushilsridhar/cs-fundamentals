think greedily at every step without considering the future outcomes and possibilities  

<ins>Fractional Knapsack</ins>  
Given a bag with a capacity, we need put the items given in the bag such that the value of the bag is maximum,  
fractional means, items can be broken down and put inside the bag  

<ins>0/1 Knapsack</ins>  
same as fractional knapsack, but the items given can not be broken, either pick or not pick
