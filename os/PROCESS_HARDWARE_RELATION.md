# Journey of Process

1. Developer codes the app, and compiles the app into a file (.class, jar, war incase of java), which is stored in hardware
2. when user starts the application, the compiled code (inside a file) is moved to RAM, 
3. Each instruction in the file is executed by the CPU by using the cores it have

<ins>Program</ins>    
a set of instructions, compiled code stored in hardware   

<ins>Process</ins>    
A program that is in running state, the compiled code is moved to RAM and CPU starts executing it 

<ins>Process control block (PCB)</ins>    
for every process that gets created, a PCB is created for it, it contains all the information about the process,    
the activity monitor in mac, get all details of processes from PCB,   

# Hardwares

<ins>Core</ins>     
Core = processor = CPU, if the chip is dual core, it means, the system has two CPUs

<ins>Quad-core Processor chip</ins>

<ins>Microcontroller</ins>    
These are mainly used in embedded system, where all the components are fabricated within the single chip itself,    
RAM, Processor etc, are within the same single chip,
